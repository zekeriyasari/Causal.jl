For example, invariants, spectral properties, or statistical information can be derived from the data, parameter estimation can be performed or various signal processing techniques can be applied to the data.

Having been triggered, a static system reads its input data, calculates its output, and writes it to its output port. In dynamical systems, however, system behavior is characterized by states and output of a dynamical system depends on input, previous state and time. Therefore, a dynamical system is defined by a state equation and an output equation. When triggered, a dynamical system reads its input, updates its state according to its state equation, calculates its output according to its output equation, and writes its output to its output port. Jusdl is capable of simulating the dynamical systems with state equations in the form of the ordinary differential equation(ODE), differential-algebraic equation(DAE), random ordinary differential equation(RODE), stochastic differential equation(SDE), delay differential equation(DDE) or discrete difference equation. Most of the available simulation environments allow the simulation of systems represented by ordinary differential equations or differential-algebraic equations. Therefore, analyzes such as noise analysis, delay analysis or random change of system parameters cannot be performed in these simulation environments. On the contrary, Jusdl makes it possible for all these analyses to be performed owing to its ability to solve such a wide range of state equations.","category":"page"},{"location":"modeling_and_simulation/modeling/#Ports-and-Connections-1","page":"Modeling","title":"Ports and Connections","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"modeling_and_simulation/modeling/#","page":"Modeling","title":"Modeling","text":"A port is actually a bunch of pins to which the connections are bound.

If a connection having an unconnected terminal is detected, the simulation is terminated at this stage. Another case where the model is not suitable for simulation is when algebraic loops exist. For example, almost every feedback system model includes algebraic loops. An algebraic loop is a closed-loop consisting of one or more components whose outputs are directly dependent on their inputs. The simulation does not continue because none of the components in the loop can generate output to break the loop. Such a problem can be broken by rearranging the model without algebraic loops, solving the feed-forward algebraic equation of the loop, or inserting a memory component with a certain initial condition anywhere in the loop. Jusdl provides all these loop-breaking solutions. During the inspection stage,  in case they are detected, all the loops are broken.

In Jusdl, it is possible to simulate discrete-time and continuous-time, static or dynamical systems. In particular, it is possible to simulate dynamical systems modeled by different types of differential equations such as ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation), Random Ordinary Differential Equation (RODE), SDE (Stochastic Differential Equation), DDE (Delay Differential Equation) and DAE (Differential Algebraic Equation), and discrete difference equations. During the simulation, the data flowing through the links of the model can be processed online and offline and specialized analyzes can be performed. These analyses can also be enriched with plugins that can easily be defined using the standard Julia library or various Julia packages. The simulation is performed by evolving the components individually and in parallel during sampling time intervals. The individual evolution of the components allows the simulation of the models that include components represented by different kinds of mathematical equations.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation-1","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Installation of Jusdl is the similar to any other registered Julia package.
