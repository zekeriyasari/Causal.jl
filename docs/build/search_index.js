To make the components have a common time base, a common time reference is used. The time reference generates pulses at simulation sampling intervals and writes these pulses to the trigger links of the components to trigger them. Each component that is triggered read its input data from its input bus, calculates its output according to its output model and writes it to its output bus.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"<center>\n    <img src=\"assets/Model/model.png\" alt=\"model\" width=\"50%\"/>\n</center>","category":"page"},{"location":"#Components-1","page":"Home","title":"Components","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The component types in JuSDL are shown in Figure 2.2 together with output and state equations. The components can be grouped as sources, sinks, and systems. The sources are components that generate signals as functions of time. Having been triggered, a source computes its output according to its output function and writes it to its output bus. The sources do not have input busses as their outputs depend only on time. The sinks are data processing units. Their primary objectives are to process the data flowing through the busses of the model online. Having been triggered, a sink reads its input data and process them, i.e. data can be visualized by being plotted on the graphical user interface, can be observed by being printed on the console, can be stored on data files. The data processing capability of the sinks can be enriched by integrating new plugins that can be developed using the standard Julia library or various available Julia packages. For example, invariants, spectral properties or statistical information can be derived from the data, parameter estimation can be performed or various signal processing techniques can be applied on the data. JuSDL has been designed to be flexible enough to allow one to enlarge the scope of its available plugins by integrating newly-defined ones.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"<center>\n    <img src=\"assets/Components/components.png\" alt=\"model\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</center>","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"As the output of a static system depends on input and time, a static system is defined by an output equation. Having been triggered, a static system reads its input data, calculates its output according to its output function and writes it to its output bus. In dynamic systems, however, system behavior is characterized by states and output of a dynamic system depends on input, previous state and time. Therefore, a dynamic system is defined by a state equation and an output equation. When triggered, a dynamic system reads its input, update its state according to its state equation, calculates its output according to its output equation and writes its output to its output bus. JuSDL is capable of simulating the dynamic systems with state equations in the form of the ordinary differential equation(ODE), differential algebraic equation(DAE), random ordinary differential equation(RODE), stochastic differential equation(SDE), delay differential equation(DDE) or discrete difference equation. Most of the available simulation environments allow the simulation of systems represented by ordinary differential equations or differential algebraic equations. Therefore, analyzes such as noise analysis, delay analysis or random change of system parameters cannot be performed in these simulation environments. On the contrary, JuSDL makes it possible for all these analyses to be performed owing to its ability to solve such a wide range of state equations.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Busses-1","page":"Home","title":"Busses","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Busses consist of bunches of links. Links are built upon channels that are defined in standard Julia library. The data written to(read from) the busses is written to(read from) the links which are then written to(read from) the channels. Active Julia tasks that are bound to channels must exist for data to flow over these channels. Ju- lia tasks are control flow features that allow calculations to be flexibly suspended and maintained without directly communicating the task scheduler of the operating system. Communication and data exchange between the tasks are carried out through Julia channels to which they are bound.

The putter and the taker task is the task that writes data to and reads data from the channel, respectively. To be able to read data from one side of the channel, an active putter task must be bound to the chan- nel at the other side of the channel, and the channel is called a readable channel. Similarly, to be able to write data to one side of the channel, an active taker task must be bound to the channel at the other side, and the channel is called a writable channel. If both active putter and taker tasks are bound to either side of the channel, then the data can both be read from and written to the channel, and the channel is called a both readable and writable channel. The data-flow through the channel is only achieved if the channel is both readable and writable channel. The data read from a readable channel is the data written to the channel by the putter task of the channel. If data has not been written yet to the channel by the putter task of the channel during a reading process, then reading does not occur and the putter task is waited to put data to the channel. Similarly, if the data on the channel has not been read yet from the channel by the taker task during a writing process, then the taker task is waited to take data from the channel. In the modeling approach adopted, the components reading data from a bus are driven by other components writing data to the bus. Therefore, all of the busses of the model must be both readable and writable busses so that data can flow the busses. This means that all the busses of the model must be connected to a component from both ends. Otherwise, the simulation gets stuck and does not end during a reading process from a channel that is not connected to a component. During the simulation, the busses can be arranged as desired, the gain of the busses can be changed, new busses can be added or an existing bus can be broken. In other words, the structure of the system being simulated can change dynamically. This allows one to perform topological studies such as the investigation of the effects of change in the topology of a network or the change o coupling strengths on the behavior of the network.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Simulation-1","page":"Home","title":"Simulation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"A model to be simulated consists of components connected to each other and a time reference.

Instead, the model is evolved by evolving the components individually by solving their own mathematical equations. The components do not evolve in one shot, but instead, they evolve in parallel for during the time intervals between subsequent sampling instants. Here, it worths noting that the type of the mathematical equations of the components of a model does not have to be the same.
