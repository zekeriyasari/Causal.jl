The data processing is done online during the simulation. Sink type is a subtype of AbstractSink. An AbstractSink is also a subtype of AbstractComponent (see Components),  so an AbstractSink instance has a trigger link to be triggered and a handshake link to signal that evolution is succeeded. In addition, an AbstractSink has an input buffer inbuf whose mode is Cyclic. When an AbstractSink instance is triggered through its trigger link, it basically reads its incoming data and writes to its input buffer inbuf. When its input buffer inbuf is full, the data in inbuf is processed according to the type of AbstractSink. Jusdl provides three concrete subtypes of AbstractSink which are Writer, Printer and Scope. As the operation of an AbstractSink depends only incoming data, an AbstractSink does not have an output.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/connections/link/#Links-1","page":"Links","title":"Links","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/connections/link/#","page":"Links","title":"Links","text":"DocTestSetup  = quote\n    using Jusdl\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/connections/link/#","page":"Links","title":"Links","text":"Links are built on top of  Channels of Julia.

The component behavior is defined by the mathematical equations obtained as a result of the physical laws that the physical quantities used in the modeling of the component must comply.

The sinks are data processing units. Their primary objectives are to process the data flowing through the busses of the model online. Having been triggered, a sink reads its input data and process them, i.e. data can be visualized by being plotted on the graphical user interface, can be observed by being printed on the console, can be stored on data files.

Therefore, a dynamic system is defined by a state equation and an output equation. When triggered, a dynamic system reads its input, update its state according to its state equation, calculates its output according to its output equation and writes its output to its output bus. JuSDL is capable of simulating the dynamic systems with state equations in the form of the ordinary differential equation(ODE), differential algebraic equation(DAE), random ordinary differential equation(RODE), stochastic differential equation(SDE), delay differential equation(DDE) or discrete difference equation. Most of the available simulation environments allow the simulation of systems represented by ordinary differential equations or differential algebraic equations. Therefore, analyzes such as noise analysis, delay analysis or random change of system parameters cannot be performed in these simulation environments.

The putter and the taker task is the task that writes data to and reads data from the channel, respectively. To be able to read data from one side of the channel, an active putter task must be bound to the chan- nel at the other side of the channel, and the channel is called a readable channel. Similarly, to be able to write data to one side of the channel, an active taker task must be bound to the channel at the other side, and the channel is called a writable channel. If both active putter and taker tasks are bound to either side of the channel, then the data can both be read from and written to the channel, and the channel is called a both readable and writable channel. The data-flow through the channel is only achieved if the channel is both readable and writable channel. The data read from a readable channel is the data written to the channel by the putter task of the channel. If data has not been written yet to the channel by the putter task of the channel during a reading process, then reading does not occur and the putter task is waited to put data to the channel. Similarly, if the data on the channel has not been read yet from the channel by the taker task during a writing process, then the taker task is waited to take data from the channel. In the modeling approach adopted, the components reading data from a bus are driven by other components writing data to the bus. Therefore, all of the busses of the model must be both readable and writable busses so that data can flow the busses. This means that all the busses of the model must be connected to a component from both ends. Otherwise, the simulation gets stuck and does not end during a reading process from a channel that is not connected to a component. During the simulation, the busses can be arranged as desired, the gain of the busses can be changed, new busses can be added or an existing bus can be broken. In other words, the structure of the system being simulated can change dynamically.
