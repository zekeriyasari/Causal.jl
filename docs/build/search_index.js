During the simulation, the data flowing through the links of the model can processed online and offline and specialized analyzes can be performed. These analyzes can also be enriched with plugins that can easily be defined using the standard Julia library or various Julia packages. The simulation is done with the parallel evolution of the model components individually and sampling sampling time intervals. The individual evolution of the components allows the simulation of the models including the components that are represented by different kinds of mathematical equations while the parallel evolution of components increases the simulation speed.

That is, model components are evolved in different time intervals, called as sampling interval. During the simulation, model components are triggered by these generated time pulses.  The Clock type is used to to generate those time pulses. The simulation time settings, the simulation start time, stop time, sampling interval are configured through the Clocks.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/components/sources/clock/#Construction-of-Clock-1","page":"Clock","title":"Construction of Clock","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/components/sources/clock/#","page":"Clock","title":"Clock","text":"Construction of Clock is done by specifying its start time and final time and the simulation sampling period.
