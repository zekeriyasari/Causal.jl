Most of the available simulation environments allow the simulation of systems represented by ordinary differential equations or differential-algebraic equations.

For example, almost every feedback system model includes algebraic loops. An algebraic loop is a closed-loop consisting of one or more components whose outputs are directly dependent on their inputs. The simulation does not continue because none of the components in the loop can generate output to break the loop. Such a problem can be broken by rearranging the model without algebraic loops, solving the feed-forward algebraic equation of the loop, or inserting a memory component with a certain initial condition anywhere in the loop. Causal provides all these loop-breaking solutions. During the inspection stage,  in case they are detected, all the loops are broken. Otherwise, a report is printed to notify the user to insert memory components to break the loops.

At this point, a putter and a taker task are bound to each connection. For example,  in the figure below(on the left) is given an example model section consisting of components B1, B and the connections L1, L2, L3. When triggered, the B1 reads data from L1  calculates its output and writes to L2. Similarly, when triggered B2   reads data from the L2, calculates its output, and writes to the L3. The tasks that are bounded to L1, L2, and L3 corresponding to B1 and B2 are shown in the figure below(on the right).  Since B1 reads the data from L1 and writes data to L2, a taker task is bounded to L1 and a putter task is bounded L2. Similarly, since B2 reads the data from L2 and writes data to L3, a taker task is bounded to L2 and a putter task is bounded L3. Since both a putter and a taker task are bound to the L2, data can flow from B1 to B2 through L2. A task manager is constructed to check whether the tasks launched during the initialization stage are active or not throughout the simulation and to report the error in case an error occurs.","category":"page"},{"location":"modeling_and_simulation/simulation/#","page":"Simulation","title":"Simulation","text":"<head>\n    <style>\n    * {\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    }\n\n    .column {\n    float: left;\n    width: 50%;\n    padding: 5px;\n    }\n\n    /* Clearfix (clear floats) */\n    .row::after {\n    content: \"\";\n    clear: both;\n    display: table;\n    }\n\n    /* Responsive layout - makes the three columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */\n    @media screen and (max-width: 500px) {\n    .column {\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n    }\n    </style>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"column\">\n            <img src=\"../../assets/TaskForComponents/components.svg\" alt=\"components\" style=\"width:70%\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"column\">\n            <img src=\"../../assets/TaskForComponents/tasks.svg\" alt=\"tasks\" style=\"width:100%\">\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>","category":"page"},{"location":"modeling_and_simulation/simulation/#","page":"Simulation","title":"Simulation","text":"The initialization stage is followed by the run the stage.

In Causal, it is possible to simulate discrete-time and continuous-time, static or dynamical systems. In particular, it is possible to simulate dynamical systems modeled by different types of differential equations such as ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation), Random Ordinary Differential Equation (RODE), SDE (Stochastic Differential Equation), DDE (Delay Differential Equation) and DAE (Differential Algebraic Equation), and discrete difference equations. During the simulation, the data flowing through the links of the model can be processed online and offline and specialized analyzes can be performed. These analyses can also be enriched with plugins that can easily be defined using the standard Julia library or various Julia packages. The simulation is performed by evolving the components individually and in parallel during sampling time intervals. The individual evolution of the components allows the simulation of the models that include components represented by different kinds of mathematical equations.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation-1","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Installation of Causal is the similar to any other registered Julia package.
